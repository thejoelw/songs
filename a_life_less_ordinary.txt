One day I sat and saw my life,
Sitting on the scales.
Music measured by the note,
Quivering and frail.

Some notes failed and others flew,
A precious few remained.
And shyly from the remnaints rose,
A beautiful refrain.

The lovely music stirred my heart,
A longing for my home.
The tender tendrils stirred my soul,
And whispers pulled me close.

But suddenly the music stopped,
Incomplete and part.
I strained to hear the final note,
But silent was the art.

The trick within the symphony,
Is to never tell the time.
Until the end, the crescendo,
Is just another rhyme.

Facing death I came alive,
And death I faced in every moment,
Since this I realized.

I've chased God and I've chased not,
And chasing leaves me dry.
But chasing after one you love,
Puts melody to rhyme.

Chase I will and seek I shall,
Until the day I die.
And ever after he will have,
To give me what is mine.
