My king,
He's there,
Heaven's voices quiet as his glory fills the air.

The elders low,
Their heads are bowed,
Still before the glory of the one who wears the crown.

And a cry arises up,
Slowly, without tongue,
It tells the dead to rise and gives new sight unto the blind.

Rise, my child, rise!
You are weak but you are strong beside the one who paints the skies.

Rise, my child, rise!
You're so small but He moves mountains just to wipe tears from your eyes.

Rise, my child, rise!
Rise, my child, rise!
Rise, my child, rise!


God you're there,
And I am here,
I've waited so so long


Not gonna wait until I die to see,
Your majesty
