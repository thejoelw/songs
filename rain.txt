The sky bleeds its rain,
Desparate to bring the earth alive,
But yet its not enough,

We ask for more,
We beg for love,
We seek the stars above,
But yet we don't know who we are.

The God of heaven said the road death is wide and broad,
Yet we follow the crowd.

We all end up the same,
Yet this wisp of wind of life,
We chase until we die.
Yet we chase the vanity of life.


We've made our own eternity,
Of vanity and death,
Full of death and vanity,
