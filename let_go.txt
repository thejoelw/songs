Only those prepared to die will find eternal life

We chase our dreams and wake to find,
That our dreams lied the whole time.


Why can't we just understand,
Letting go precedes the stand.
The life we hold so fast will fade,
What we let go will remain.

I ask for signs but silence speaks,
Of whispered rumors of a King.
The faintest glimmer of a sword,
Awaiting the day of the Lord.

We've abandoned our Father,
Who laid down His son.
One day we'll beg Him,
